PROJECT TITLE

RetailMind – AI-Driven Real-Time Marketing Decision Intelligence System

🔷 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Build a full-stack web application that provides a unified, real-time marketing decision intelligence dashboard for retail managers.

The system must:

Unify campaign, sales, customer behavior, and budget data

Provide AI-based hybrid recommendations

Detect anomalies in campaign performance

Simulate budget allocation scenarios

Generate automated natural-language reports

Support role-based dashboards (Manager, Analyst, Leadership)

🔷 TECH STACK (MANDATORY)

Frontend:

React (Vite or Next.js)

Tailwind CSS

Chart.js or Recharts

Axios

Socket.io client (for real-time updates)

Backend:

Flask (Python)

Pandas

Scikit-learn

OpenAI API (for natural language insights)

Flask-SocketIO

SQLite (initially)

REST APIs

Optional:

Redis (for caching)

Docker (if supported)

🔷 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Frontend (React)
⬇
Backend API (Flask REST)
⬇
AI Decision Engine
⬇
Data Layer (CSV / SQLite)
⬇
Real-time layer via Socket.io

🔷 CORE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
1️⃣ DATA UNIFICATION MODULE

Create a unified marketing data model combining:

Campaign Data (impressions, clicks, spend, channel)

Sales Data (revenue, transactions, product)

Customer Behavior (segments, repeat rate, cart size)

Budget Data (allocated vs used)

Backend Tasks:

Create sample CSV datasets

Load using Pandas

Merge into unified dataframe

Expose /api/dashboard-summary

Frontend:

Single dashboard view showing:

Total revenue

ROI

Conversion rate

Budget used %

Channel comparison chart

2️⃣ AI DECISION ENGINE

Implement hybrid recommendation logic:

A. Rule-Based Logic:

If ROI < threshold → Suggest pause

If conversion high & budget low → Suggest scale

If spend high but sales low → Alert

B. ML Model:

Train simple regression model predicting ROI or sales uplift

Use scikit-learn

C. Anomaly Detection:

Use IsolationForest or Z-score

Detect unusual spend spikes or drop in conversions

Expose API:
/api/recommendations
/api/anomalies

Frontend:

Show:

Action cards (Pause / Scale / Monitor)

Alert banner (Red if anomaly detected)

3️⃣ CAMPAIGN HEALTH MONITOR

Color-coded campaign statuses:

🟢 Healthy (ROI > threshold)

🟡 Needs Attention

🔴 Critical

Backend:

Logic-based scoring system

Return health score per campaign

Frontend:

Table with colored badges

Filter by status

4️⃣ BUDGET SIMULATOR

Interactive optimizer.

Frontend:

Sliders to adjust budget allocation across channels

Simulate impact

Backend:

Predict revenue based on adjusted budget

Return projected ROI

API:
/api/budget-simulate

5️⃣ AUTOMATED REPORTS

Generate Natural Language summary:

Example:
"This week, social campaigns delivered 12% higher ROI while email underperformed. Consider reallocating 15% budget."

Backend:

Use OpenAI API

Send structured metrics

Return formatted executive summary

Also:

Enable export to PDF or CSV

6️⃣ ROLE-BASED DASHBOARDS

Implement authentication (basic role system).

Roles:

Manager → Full dashboard + recommendations

Analyst → Detailed data view + export

Leadership → High-level KPIs + ROI summary only

Backend:

Simple role-based route control

Frontend:

Conditional rendering based on role
